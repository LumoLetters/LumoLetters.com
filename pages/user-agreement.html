        LumoLetters provides a personalized subscription service. Based on the interests and preferences you provide, we use artificial intelligence technology to generate draft letter content. This AI-generated content is then reviewed and curated by our human editorial team before being physically mailed to you as a monthly letter.

      <h2 class="content-item-heading">3. Subscription, Fees, and Payment</h2>
      
      <h3 class="content-item-heading">3.1 Subscription</h3>
      <p class="content-item-paragraph">
        By subscribing, you authorize LumoLetters to charge the subscription fee at the then-current rate to your chosen payment method via our third-party payment processor, Stripe. Your use of Stripe is subject to Stripe's Terms of Service, and you agree to comply with Stripe's terms when making payments.
      </p>

      <h3 class="content-item-heading">3.2 Billing Cycle</h3>
      <p class="content-item-paragraph">
        Subscription fees are billed in advance on a monthly basis and automatically renew until you cancel. Your subscription will renew on the same calendar day each month (or the closest available date if that day does not exist in a particular month).
      </p>

      <h3 class="content-item-heading">3.3 Price Changes</h3>
      <p class="content-item-paragraph">
        We reserve the right to change our subscription fees at any time. Any price changes will be communicated to you at least 60 days (approximately 2 months) before they take effect. If you do not agree to the price change, you may cancel your subscription before the new price takes effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the modified fee.
      </p>

      <h3 class="content-item-heading">3.4 Cancellation</h3>
      <p class="content-item-paragraph">
        You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting us at info@lumoletters.com. Cancellation stops future billing but does not trigger a refund for the current billing period. You will continue to receive service through the end of your current billing cycle.
      </p>

      <h3 class="content-item-heading">3.5 Refunds</h3>
      <p class="content-item-paragraph">

      <h3 class="content-item-heading">4.4 Lost or Damaged Mail</h3>
      <p class="content-item-paragraph">

        If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you and LumoLetters agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.
